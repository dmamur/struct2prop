In this folder, additional models trained on the SrTiO3 and surface datasets from https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c04252 are presented.
The spectral data is also accessible at  https://github.com/vxfung/MatDeepLearn_DOS/tree/master/data

embed_sto.ipynb is a Python notebook that constructs eDOS model for SrTiO3 from the scratch. It begins by retrieving data from figshare.com and proceeds to plot both the reference and predicted spectra from the test set.


embed_surface.ipynb is a Python notebook that fits eDOS model for surface eDOS from the scratch.
